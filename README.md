# LazyPredict
"Lazy Predict" is a machine learning technique that can be used to make predictions using minimal data preparation and without the need for complex feature engineering. It is based on the idea that a good machine learning model can be built using only a small subset of the available features, and that the remaining features are not necessary for making accurate predictions.

The main idea behind lazy predict is to use a simple and fast algorithm to quickly identify the most important features, and then use those features to train a more complex model. This approach can save time and resources, as it eliminates the need for extensive data preparation and feature engineering.

Lazy predict is often used in situations where time or resources are limited, such as in online or real-time applications, or when working with large datasets. It can also be useful for quickly prototyping a model and testing its performance before investing more time and resources into feature engineering and model tuning.

It's also important to note that while lazy predict can be a useful approach in some cases, it is not a panacea, and it may not be the best approach for all problems. It's important to evaluate the performance of the model and it's trade offs before applying it.
